# --- Step 1: Check current iptables rules ---
sudo iptables -L

# --- Step 2: Set Default iptables Policies ---
# Set default policies to drop all incoming and forwarded traffic, allow outgoing traffic
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

# --- Step 3: Allow Specific Traffic in iptables ---
# Allow SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80) traffic
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

# --- Step 4: Allow Traffic from Specific IP Address in iptables ---
# Allow SSH from a specific IP (replace <source_ip> with the IP you want to allow)
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s <source_ip> --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

# --- Step 5: Block an IP Address in iptables ---
# Block a specific IP address (replace <source_ip> with the IP you want to block)
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s <source_ip> -j DROP

# --- Step 6: Save iptables Rules ---
# Save iptables rules to make them persistent (Ubuntu-based systems)
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4

# --- Step 7: Flush iptables Rules (if needed) ---
# To clear all iptables rules
sudo iptables -F

# --- Step 8: Install ufw if not installed ---
# Install ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall)
sudo apt install ufw -y

# --- Step 9: Enable ufw ---
# Enable ufw firewall
sudo ufw enable

# --- Step 10: Check ufw Status ---
# Check the status of ufw and current rules
sudo ufw status verbose

# --- Step 11: Allow Specific Traffic in ufw ---
# Allow SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80) traffic
sudo ufw allow 22
sudo ufw allow 80

# --- Step 12: Allow Traffic from Specific IP in ufw ---
# Allow SSH from a specific IP address (replace <source_ip> with the IP you want to allow)
sudo ufw allow from <source_ip> to any port 22

# --- Step 13: Deny Specific Traffic in ufw ---
# Deny all traffic from a specific IP address (replace <source_ip> with the IP you want to block)
sudo ufw deny from <source_ip>

# --- Step 14: Set Default Policies in ufw ---
# Set default policies to deny incoming traffic and allow outgoing traffic
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

# --- Step 15: Reset ufw to Default Rules (if needed) ---
# Reset ufw and remove all rules
sudo ufw reset

# --- Step 16: Disable ufw (if needed) ---
# Disable ufw firewall
sudo ufw disable

# --- Step 17: Install and Enable SSL for Apache (Optional) ---
# Install Certbot for SSL
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache -y

# Obtain SSL certificate for your domain (replace example.com with your actual domain)
sudo certbot --apache -d example.com

# --- Step 18: Enable ufw Logging (Optional) ---
# Enable logging to track denied traffic
sudo ufw logging on

# --- Step 19: Limit SSH Connections (Optional) ---
# Enable rate limiting on SSH to prevent brute-force attacks
sudo ufw limit 22
